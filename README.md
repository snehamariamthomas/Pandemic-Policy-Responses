# Summary
This research explored how countries worldwide responded to the COVID-19 pandemic through stay-at-home directives and income support measures from 2020 to 2022. It aimed to assess the effectiveness of these policies in managing public health and economic challenges during the crisis.

The study's significance lies in its comprehensive analysis of global policy responses, providing insights into the varying approaches taken by different regions. Key observations revealed that regions with robust income support systems generally implemented stricter stay-at-home measures, which correlated with more effective control of COVID-19 transmission. In contrast, regions without adequate income support often faced challenges in enforcing consistent restrictions, impacting their ability to contain the virus effectively.

These findings underscore the importance of integrated policy frameworks that combine public health interventions with strong economic support mechanisms. They emphasize the critical role of income support in enabling timely and effective crisis responses, highlighting areas for improvement in global pandemic preparedness and response strategies.
